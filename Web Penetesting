Web Penetration 

Pentesting techniques :

	 1.Information gathering,
	 2.Scanning and enumeration,
	 3.Exploitation,
	 4.Maintaining access,
	 5. Cleanp
 Tools:
 	Burp Suit(Pro)
 	Nikto,
 	Dirbuster,
 	Curl,
 	Sublist3r,
 	Nmap,
 	and More..
 	
 Attacks:
 	
 	OWASP Top 10 (eg Injection, Broken Autentication, XXS, XXE, etc)
 	and Some More
 
 Other:
 	Importtant Documents,
 	Resources,
 	Career Advice, Etc.
 
   
 FIVE STAGES OF HACKING:
 	1.Reconnaissance:
 		=>	Information Gathering :
 			=>		Active and Passive,
 				
 					
 	2.Scanning and Enumeration,
 	3.Gaining Access,
 	4.Maintaining Access,
 	5.Covering Tracks.
 
 * Passive Recinnaissance :
 	
 	* Target Validation:
 		=> WHOIS, nslooup, dnsrecon
 	* Finding Subdomains:
 		=> Google Fu, dig, Nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto,Crt.sh, etc.
 	* Fingerprinting:
 		=> Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb,BuuiltWith,Netcat
 	* Data Breaches:
 		HaveIBeenPwned and Similar lists
 		
 		
 	*****************************   TASK	*****************************************			
 		We Have been Asked to gather information about the company

 Another site like sublist3r is 
 	=> crt.sh
 
 To find weakness in website search it through 
 	=> securityheaders.io
 		
To practise a pre vernability website
	=> dvwa.co.uk

ip scan:
	=> nikto -h 192.168.48.5 -p 80
 
 HIDE BEFORE YOU ATTACK
 BEAWARE WHILE USING IT, IT SENDS LOTS OF IP REQUESTS

        => https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester
 after downloding run:
        => pip3 install -r requirements.txt
To run :

    04Masscan

Masscan is use to scan the internet really fast 

    =>masscan -p1-65535 192.168.10.2
To incerese the speed of the scan;
