# Reverse and Bind Shell:

### Reverse shell:
  ` Now reverse shells what they do is we set up a listener.
    When a victim connects back to us that is considered reverse shell. `

 ####  When we connect to a victim.
 ### Bind Shell :
  ` So say we run an exploit and we open up a port and then we say hey let's connect to that port that is
  considered a bind shell. `
